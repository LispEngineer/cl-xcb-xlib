Additions
=========

There are a few additions to CLX to support extended functionality:

* display-funcall DISPLAY FUNCTION

  (This is used by WITH-DISPLAY, there shouldn't be a common need to
  call this directly.)

  Call FUNCTION in the dedicated thread for DISPLAY.  Each DISPLAY is
  automatically created with a dedicated thread, and ideally all
  operations should be done on this thread.  GLX/GL calls _must_ be
  done on this thread.

  FUNCTION is called synchronously and its result is returned from
  DISPLAY-FUNCALL.

  OPEN-DISPLAY should not be called this way since, obviously, one
  does not have an existing DISPLAY.  OPEN-DISPLAY creates the
  dedicated thread and does the actual opening on that thread
  internally.

* *DISPLAY*

  The default display.  This is only valid and should only be bound in
  a dedicated display thread.  It is bound by default when the thread
  is created, and unbound when CLOSE-DISPLAY is called.

* display-for OBJECT

  Generic function which may be specialized to return a DISPLAY for
  OBJECT.  CLX defines functions such as DRAWABLE-DISPLAY and
  WINDOW-DISPLAY which do this for specific types.  These functions
  are implemented and work normally.

  DISPLAY-FOR a DISPLAY is the same DISPLAY.

* display-ptr-xcb OBJECT

  Return a pointer which is the xcb_connection_t for OBJECT.  Utilizes
  DISPLAY-FOR to obtain the DISPLAY.

* display-ptr-xlib OBJECT

  Return a pointer which is the libX11 Display for OBJECT.  Utilizes
  DISPLAY-FOR to obtain the DISPLAY.

* xid DRAWABLE

  Return the XID for DRAWABLE (and any derived types, such as WINDOW
  or PIXMAP).  Both XCB and libX11 calls often use this value.
