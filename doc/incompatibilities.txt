Incompatibilities
=================

This is a list of things which may need changing when coming from
a native CLX.

* define-event: this is not directly compatible.  See examples in
  `src/clx/event-decl.lisp`.  You shouldn't need to use this unless
  you're implementing an extension.

* GLX, OpenGL: The calls here are similar, and may be compatible, but
  your code may not.  This is due to libraries using a newer GL
  standard than GL server calls.  Any code which uses direct GL would
  have to do this.

* display-authorization-{data,name}: It is apparently not possible to
  get this data from XCB.  In theory one could manually manage
  authorization and store the info passed to to
  xcb_connect_to_display_with_auth_info, but it doesn't seem worth the
  effort.  These functions therefore return empty strings.

* access-hosts, {add,remove}-access-host: This isn't technically
  incompatible as the documentation says "or some other type of
  object", but it should be noted that this uses vectors of
  (unsigned-byte 8).  For instance:

      (add-access-host *display* #(127 0 0 1))

  Likewise, access-hosts returns a list of vectors in this form.  For
  the optional FAMILY argument to {add,remove}-access-host, the format
  may be different, of course.
